# API_Starter_Kit

This repository includes some examples of how to use Quant-Insight API. 

## What do you need to start using the API?

* API key

  * If you still don't have an API key, you can contact Quant-Insight to get a API trial key. 
  
  * If you already have an API key, you just need to add it in this part of the code: 
  
    configuration = qi_client.Configuration()
    configuration.api_key['X-API-KEY'] = 'API-KEY'
