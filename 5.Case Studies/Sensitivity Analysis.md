# Sensitivity Analysis

Here we showcase how Qi uses the API to find assets sensitive to a key theme.

## Case Study 1: '10 EU Stocks Vulnerable to deflation' - Mar 2020

* Back in mid February with Western equity markets seemingly immune, the key question facing a European long/short equity fund was which stocks are most vulnerable should Covid-19 spread and unleash a deflationary shock in this time zone? 

* On February 17th , the last week of complacency before the virus reached these shores, we screened the Stoxx 600 universe for those single names most sensitive to European inflation expectations, 

* The 10 stocks Qi identified as most sensitive to inflation fell 43% from February 17th to yesterdayâ€™s close. Over the same period, the Euro Stoxx 600 fell 34%.

* Code:

      ### Variables ###
      universe = [x.name for x in api_instance.get_models(tags='Stoxx Europe 600')][::2]
      date = '2020-02-17'
      term = 'Long Term'
      driver_rank = 7   # The factor has to feature in the top 7 factors for an asset for it to be considered
      no_of_stocks = 10
      factor = 'Euro 5y Infl. Expec.'

      df = pandas.DataFrame()

      for asset in universe:

          try:

              df_temp = get_factor_drivers(stock,date,term).T
              df_temp.index = [asset]        

              if factor in abs(df_temp.loc[asset]).nlargest(driver_rank).index:

                  df = df.append(df_temp)

          except IndexError:

              pass

      df_factor = df[[factor]]
      df_factor['RSq'] = [float(get_model_data(asset,date,date,'Long Term')['Rsq']) for asset in df_factor.index]
      df_top_sensitivite = df_factor[df_factor['RSq']>65].nlargest(no_of_stocks,factor)
      df_top_sensitivite['Name'] = [api_instance.get_model(model).security_name for model in df_top_sensitivite.index]
